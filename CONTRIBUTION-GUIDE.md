Hi there! Welcome to the contribution guide for the MedX open-source project. We're thrilled to have you on board!

This guide is designed to help you contribute to MedX. If you are new to contributing to open-source projects, we recommend reading the [Why Contribution](https://github.com/MedX-Media/MedX/blob/main/CONTRIBUTION-WHY.md) document to learn about the reasons of others.

We believe that any contribution, big or small, is valuable. This guide is simply here to make contributing even easier for those who want to dive deeper.

Remember, MedX is an "open-source" project, meaning you can contribute to "anything", including this very document! So, if you have an idea, don't hesitate to share it. :)

There are two main ways to contribute: development and content creation.

- For development contributions, head over to the [issues tab](https://github.com/MedX-Media/MedX/issues) and get started with "good first issues". but before that, read the issues part of this guide to be familiar how it works.
- Content creators can also contribute by writing in the website. but before that make sure to read our [content principles](https://github.com/MedX-Media/MedX/blob/main/ContentPrinciples.md) document.

---> *Looking for a good place to start?* Join our ["Inside MedX" Telegram channel](https://t.me/insidemedx), where we announce MedX's needs and reports, including "good first issues" for newcomers and monthly reports for the people who want to know about our status.

# issues

## general questions about issues
### what are the issues? why do we need them?

### who is responsible for an issue?
all assigned individuals are responsible for an issue's completion and results. however, if multiple people are assigned, the person who created the issue and set the deadline has primary responsibility.

### where we can talk about issues?
you can talk about them on their page. you can also talk about them in our [developer communities](https://github.com/Sinusealpha/MedX/blob/main/COMMUNITY.md).

## creating issues
### when to create an issue?
an issue should be created when:
- you want to start working on something.
- you identify something that needs to be worked on, either by yourself or others.

### how to create an issue?
1. navigate to the project's issues tab.
2. click the "new issue" button.
3. set its title and description as clear and detailed as possible.
4. submit.

### what to consider when creating an issue?
- assignee: every issue must be assigned at least to a person. this could be yourself or a team of people.
- deadline: set a clear deadline for each issue. issues without deadlines should not even exist!
- tags: apply at least one tag to every issue. use correct tags that accurately reflect the issue's nature.  
for example:  
---> 'good first issue': suitable for new contributors.  
---> 'bug': reports a defect or error.  
---> 'enhancement': suggest a new feature or improvement.
